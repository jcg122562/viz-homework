Today, November 8th 2019, exactly three years have passed since the 2016 US presidential election. 
At this hour back then, the people of the United States exercised their right to elect their president 
in what turned out to be the most polarizing US election in history. 
Had I done this twitter posting analysis of Trump and Clinton three years ago before the election, 
I could have predicted, with significant confidence, that Donald Trump would emerge as the winner. 

The figure  17_ScatterRetweetAndFavorite.png, shows the comparison of retweets and favorites 
of the two candidates, as visualized in the scatter chart model. I believe that this visualization
can easily tell the story for this type of dataset.  Other chart types can also show easily the comparison, 
however, with the right color coding being red as for Trump and blue for Clinton in a scatter plot, 
you can easily see which color dominated the figure and in this case, the red.

The pie, line and bar charts can tell me numbers, but for this type of analysis which is more on behavioral
analysis wherein I am examining the relationship of two variables, scatter plot is the best chart to use.

I like the use of the WORDCLOUD too which I have tried to incorporate in this assignment.  In this way, 
I can show what are the top positive and negative words used by the two candidates.
